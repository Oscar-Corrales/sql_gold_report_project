Customer Behavior Analysis - SQL Project

Project Overview

- This project analyzes customer buying patterns and behavior using SQL. 
- I looked at 18,482 customers to find problems with keeping customers and ways to make more money. 
- The analysis shows which customer groups are most valuable and where the business is losing customers.

Business Questions Answered
- Which customer segments drive our business?
- How engaged are our customers?
- Which age groups are most valuable?
- How does each customer segment perform relative to the overall average?

Key Findings
- 66% of customers are 50+, only 1% are 30-39 (risk of losing customers as they age)
- 79% are "New" customers who don't buy much ($757 average value)
- VIP customers (9%) make almost the same money as New customers (79%)
- 63% of customers buy once and never come back
- One-time buyers are a big opportunity to improve

Dataset Information
- Total Customers: 18,482
- Total Revenue: $29.5M
- Data Period: 2014 (Historical Analysis)

SQL Skills Used
- GROUP BY to count and sum data
- Grouping customers into segments
- Window functions to compare to averages
- CASE statements to create categories
- Calculating important business numbers (customer value, order value, engagement)
- Turning data into clear business insights

Business Value
- Found that 40%+ of customers leave after first purchase
- Showed VIP customers are worth 8x more than New customers
- Found risk in having mostly older customers
- Gave clear steps to keep customers longer
- Identified which age groups and segments to focus on

What We Should Do
- Create programs to turn New customers into Regular and VIP customers
- Find out why people aged 30-39 aren't buying and fix it
- Follow up with customers after first purchase to keep them coming back
- Offer rewards for customers who buy multiple times
- Market to younger people to keep business healthy long-term

Tools Used
- SQL Server
- CTEs, Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions, CASE Statements
